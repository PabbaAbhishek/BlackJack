# BlackJack
This is the black jack game run on python.
As you run the game, you will be given two cards and the computer ji gets a single card.
Before computer ji gets the second card, you are given a chance to pick third card.
If you think your two cards sum would be higher than the computer ji's sum of two cards, choose thrid card or else not.
When computer ji draws second card and his sum would be greater than your cards sum, he wins or else you win.
**But..**
Here comes the but, anytime during the game, if either of yours sum exceeds 21, you loose.
Make right decisions and challenge your brain.
